# Web-Dev__II--SA2-MultiDevice-Application
## Tasked 
- to create a single-page web application, comprised of a responsive front-end written in HTML/CSS and a small back-end created using Node.js. 
- It is up to you what your application will be. 
- The front-end should be responsive to at least phone and desktop devices.


You should demonstrate a solid grasp of responsive design principles, focusing on both visual clarity and user experience. The back-end should serve static content (e.g. stylesheets, images, etc) and implement at least one additional feature. For example, it might serve a dynamic webpage, use data from a database or web API, or allow users to “log-in” to access content. Your implementation should efficiently use modern web development techniques. You must iteratively design, implement, and document your project. Your documentation should explain how and why you changed the application as you iterated, and provide clear evidence of the process. Evidence could include design wireframes, test plans, peer feedback, and GitHub commits.
